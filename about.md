## Here I am.

This garden is inspired by the brilliant [[Raghu::https://twitter.com/raghuveerdotnet]]. 

We've come so far for a beautiful software, and now we want to start from the beginning. I want a simple place to keep track of my learning, and flexible enough to play with new stuff. This looks like a friendly and functional playground.

[[**First Design**<img src="/assets/img/firstoutreach.jpg"/>::lmn]]Why is the website structured the way it is?

{:.boxit}
> The design of the website is inspired by multiple sources with the intention of making the website more functional. Having said that, I am not a skilled front-end developer/UI-developer, so I could only come somewhat closer to my inital design that I sketched *(see left or click on this &#8853; icon beside the question above if you are on a mobile device)*, hopefully this will clear why it's structured the way it is. In fact, I had to remove the lab option because of my current inability to design it. That said, I can also safely say that I am improving based on the initial iterations of the website that can be seen here: [[Jan-22-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200122164405/raghuveer.net]], [[Apr-13-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200413193808/raghuveer.net]], [[Apr-20-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200420172058/raghuveer.net]]
